## Mechanics for the Game:
Gameplay details –
Each user has a 2D line that represents their sprite for their player. The user is supposed to use their sprite to make other users collide with them
The user uses W-A-S-D keys to move their sprite around the game canvas.

## Scoring/point system –
As each player is moving along the canvas their points are going up by 1 with the time, i.e. 1-point equals 1 second.
The longer you last the more your total score will be.  Users scores get reset to zero if they collide with another user.
